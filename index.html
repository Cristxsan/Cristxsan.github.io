        <h2>Personal description</h2>
        <p>Sup! Cristóbal here, a 23 years old guy, born and raised in Santiago de Chile. I like music, good movies
            and some times read books from Dostoievski, Kafka, Cortazar and others. 
            I'm currently studying civil engineering in computing, so i do like a lot video games mostly FPS
            but i also enjoy the ones with a good story. I'm a person who likes to try new things 
            last one was climbing wall and lately i've been learning how to play the guitar.</p>
